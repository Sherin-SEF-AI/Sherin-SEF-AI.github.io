        <h1>Sherin Joseph Roy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Also known as: Sherin Roy</p>
        <p class="title">Co-Founder & Head of Products at <a href="https://deepmostai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepMost AI</a></p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm <strong>Sherin Joseph Roy</strong>—my legal name is <strong>Sherin Roy</strong>, and Joseph is my baptismal name that I use consistently across all professional contexts. Both names refer to the same person.</p>
        
        <p>I co-founded <a href="https://deepmostai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepMost AI</a> to build enterprise artificial intelligence systems that think with people, not for them. Our focus is contextual intelligence: AI that understands business context, organizational constraints, and when to admit uncertainty rather than providing confident but unreliable answers.</p>
        
        <p>My work addresses what I call the "trust gap" in AI adoption—the distance between what AI systems can do and what organizations feel safe deploying in production. We build AI agents with transparent autonomy: systems that operate independently while maintaining explainability, confidence assessment, and human collaboration.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-im-building">
        <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
        
        <h3>DeepMost AI</h3>
        <p>Enterprise AI infrastructure focused on contextual intelligence. We build AI agents that understand business context, organizational constraints, and when uncertainty matters more than speed.</p>
        
        <h3>Lexeek</h3>
        <p>An enterprise knowledge platform that transforms how organizations discover and act on information through conversational intelligence.</p>
        
        <h3>SEF (Safety Ecosystem Framework)</h3>
        <p>AI + IoT infrastructure for real-time risk detection, emergency coordination, and predictive safety analytics at scale.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approach">
        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>I believe technology should augment human capabilities, not attempt to replace human judgment. The best AI systems are those that make us better thinkers, not those that think for us.</p>
        
        <p>This philosophy shapes everything we build: prioritizing reliability over impressiveness, context over speed, and trust over automation. We optimize for what actually gets deployed and used, not what generates the best demo.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="writing">
        <h2>What I Write About</h2>
        <p>Through <strong>"Notes by Sherin,"</strong> I share honest reflections on building an AI company in India, the trust gap in enterprise AI adoption, product development in rapidly evolving markets, and lessons learned from both successful and failed implementations.</p>
        
        <p>Writing for builders who are tired of AI hype and want honest conversations about what creates lasting value.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Before co-founding DeepMost AI, I developed experience in product development and system architecture, learning that building technology people love requires understanding people as deeply as understanding technology.</p>
